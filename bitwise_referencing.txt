Significance of masking:

    - The value 0x0F (or 1111 in binary):
        Isolate the last 4 bits of a number.
        Ignore all other bits except the last 4 bits.
    - The value of 0xff (or 1111 1111 in binary):
        Extracts(Isolate) the last 8 bits 

### 8 bits = 1 byte

Structure of a float point:
1 bit(sign) + 8 bit(exponent) + 23 bit(fraction)

Special float:
    - +- 0: exp == -; fraction == 0; 
    - +inf: sign == 0; exp == 255; fraction == 0
    - -inf: sign == 1; exp == 255; fraction == 0
    - NaN: exp == 255; fraction != 0

Bitwise:
    - AND &: extract certain bit -> when question asking specific position (i,e the 3rd bit is 0x04); isolate parts of number
    - OR |: set certain set -> when question asking to enbale or set a specific bit or bits to 1
